'Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache, and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for.\r\n\r\nMost people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html\"> Read More </a>'), 
(NULL, 'What should I do if I feel sick?', 'If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that if you’re sick or think you’re sick, but only mildly ill, you should isolate yourself, and you shouldn’t leave your house except to go to the doctor.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3dZDiCa\"> Read More </a>'),
(NULL, 'Is there a vaccine yet?', 'Not yet.\r\n\r\nThe first coronavirus vaccine to be tested in people appears to be safe and able to stimulate an immune response against the infection, the manufacturer, Moderna, announced in May, offering a glint of hope to a world desperate for ways to stop the pandemic.\r\n\r\nBut despite this rapid progress, even if the vaccine is proved safe and effective against the virus, it will not be available until at least the end of the year.'), 
(NULL, 'Should I wear a mask?', 'The C.D.C. recommends that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This shift in federal guidance, announced by President Trump at a White House briefing, reflects new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms.\r\n\r\nUntil now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times and other news outlets had been reporting the C.D.C.’s previous guidance.\r\n\r\nMasks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://nyti.ms/3iu8qgz\"> Read More </a>'),
(NULL, 'Why is it called the coronavirus?', 'Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that infect animals and people. In February, the W.H.O. gave official names to both this virus (SARS-CoV-2, for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and the disease it causes (Covid-19, for coronavirus disease 2019).\r\n\r\nYou may have heard it called the “new” or “novel” coronavirus, and those mean just what they sound like: that it’s new.'),
(NULL, 'Can the coronavirus live on my clothes?', 'Yes, but a different question is what you should do about it.\r\n\r\nA virus tends to live longer on some nonporous surfaces, like steel or plastic, as compared to fabrics like cotton or leather. But after numerous people who attended a Buddhist temple in Hong Kong fell ill, health workers did find coronavirus on the cloth covers of prayer books, among other items.\r\n\r\nIt’s probably not worth looking up stats and studies about every kind of surface in your life. The takeaway is the same: Disinfect surfaces that are touched a lot and wash your hands after touching anything, and especially before touching your face or eating. (Two Broadway composers even wrote you a song to sing while you wash).'), 
(NULL, 'How long can the virus live on a doorknob? On cash? On my keyboard?', 'The coronavirus can live up to 72 hours on some surfaces, like plastic and steel, according to a recent study. It can survive on cardboard for up to 24 hours.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that coronaviruses are easy to destroy. A disinfectant on a surface will render it harmless, according to Gary Whittaker, a professor of virology at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine.\r\n\r\nAlthough the W.H.O. has not said that cash transmits the virus, the organization said in a statement that “it is good hygiene practice to wash your hands after handling money, especially if eating or handling food.”\r\n\r\nAre you sensing a theme? Wash your hands after touching almost anything, especially if it’s a surface outside your home.')
(NULL, 'Can I give blood?', 'You can. Donor blood is not being used to treat coronavirus patients, but transfusions are still needed for cases like organ transplants or complications of childbirth.\r\n\r\nThe American Red Cross is collecting donations at blood banks, which have enacted new safety measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Those measures include checking the temperatures of staff members and donors before they enter a drive facility, providing hand sanitizer for use before and during the donation process, enhancing their disinfection of surfaces and equipment, and spacing beds — when possible — to enable social distancing between donors.\r\n\r\nAnd even if you’re under a stay-at-home order, donating blood is an essential need, so public health officials have made an exception for your trip to the donation center.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://nyti.ms/2Z3a80V\"> Read More </a>'), 
(NULL, 'Should I make hand sanitizer?', 'Until a few months ago, most of us didn’t give hand sanitizer much thought. Now it’s sold out around the world, prompting a variety of do-it-yourself recipes that are designed to be mixed up in a home kitchen.\r\n\r\nBut medical experts discourage D.I.Y. sanitizer for a variety of reasons. For starters, it lacks quality control — a wrong measurement or ingredient and you may end up with less alcohol than needed to kill germs, or a mixture that is contaminated.\r\n\r\nAnd then there’s the larger concern that sanitizer — whether it’s store bought or home made — is not as effective at killing germs as just washing your hands with soap and water.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://nyti.ms/38yzCGn\"> Read More </a> '),
(NULL, 'How can I help the health workers?', 'Many medical workers are coping with an onslaught of sick or anxious patients and inadequate supplies of personal protective equipment (P.P.E.).\r\n\r\nAt the most basic level, you can help by following the rules on social distancing and staying home. Beyond that, you could also contribute to on-going efforts to procure P.P.E. or offer a place to stay.\r\n\r\nAnd there are of course many lovely creative ways to show appreciation:” Staff members at hospitals in New Orleans came to work one day to find large signs had been erected overnight, saying, “Heroes work here.”\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://nyti.ms/3iF9cHM\"> Read More </a> '), 
(NULL, 'My kids are scared. What can I tell them?', 'Before you talk to your children, it’s important to understand your own anxiety and keep it in check. If your child is worried about the coronavirus, listen to him or her, rather than respond with comments like, “It’ll be fine.” Dismissive reactions can make children feel like they’re not being heard, said Abi Gewirtz, a clinical psychologist and professor at the University of Minnesota.\r\n\r\nEmphasize the importance of washing hands after using the bathroom and before or after meals. Children (and adults) should sing “Happy Birthday” twice to make sure they’ve been washing their hands for at least 20 seconds. You should also frame school cancellation as positive — more time to have more fun at home! — and encourage your children to get exercise.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://nyti.ms/3e0RpXY\"> Read Here </a>'),
(NULL, 'I’m worried about my children’s mental health. What can I do?', 'In some cases, exposure to stressful events — which right now might include the absence of routines, a parent’s job loss and economic hardship, or the serious illness or death of someone a child cares about — can leave children feeling traumatized.\r\n\r\nWhen we see a child acting in a manner that we think is inappropriate, we need to consider that the child is outside her window of tolerance for stress. Monitor their behavior closely, and consider seeking counseling if you aren’t sure whether the stress response you’re seeing is normal.\r\n\r\nTalking about the pandemic and its impact may help avoid the harmful effects of stress. Help your kids understand that there are things they can do to help others — like staying home whenever possible and wearing a mask when they go out. Kids feel good when they know they are helping solve a problem.\r\n\r\nAlso, avoid making assumptions. While we may be struggling with schools being closed, kids could be rejoicing in it. We might assume our kids miss their friends, but they may appreciate having more time with us. And some who were dealing with bullying or social challenges at school may be relieved not to have to see other kids.'), 
(NULL, 'My child has mild cold or flu symptoms. Should I take him to the hospital?', 'No. Coronavirus symptoms can include fever, dry cough or shortness of breath. If your child has other symptoms, like mild fever, runny nose or sore throat, you should call your pediatrician first before going anywhere. “We want people who are not critically ill to stay out of the hospital,” said Dr. Rebecca Pellett Madan, M.D., a pediatric infectious disease specialist at N.Y.U. Langone’s Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital.\r\n\r\nIf your child develops more severe symptoms, such as trouble breathing, an inability to eat or drink or a change in behavior, you should visit a doctor, Dr. Madan said.'),
(NULL, 'Can I travel? Is it safe?', 'Yes, depending on where you want to go, and not easily, as where it is possible to travel and whether it is wise to do so are increasingly complicated questions.\r\n\r\nIn March, as more and more governments around the world hoped to slow the spread of the coronavirus, they imposed travel restrictions and many closed their borders. Now some states and countries are opening up, but it\'s a complicated patchwork of what is open and whether self-isolation or quarantines are required for entry.\r\n\r\nAnd if you do have to travel, remember to practice social distancing: Stay away from groups and keep at least six feet of distance between you and other people. Many destinations, from Spain to Massachusetts, continue to urge visitors to self-isolate for two weeks after entry.'), 
(NULL, 'How can I stay motivated with everything going on?', 'As the weeks morph into months with no clear end in sight for the pandemic, the ennui of coronavirus-induced isolation can undermine our enthusiasm for getting anything done.\r\n\r\nIf that sounds familiar, remember: Doing what’s meaningful — acting on what really matters to a person — is the antidote to burnout.\r\n\r\nMotivation might best be fostered by dividing large goals into small, specific tasks more easily accomplished, but not so simple that they are boring and soon abandoned. Avoid perfectionism lest the ultimate goal becomes an insurmountable challenge. As each task is completed, reward yourself with virtual brownie points (not chips or cookies!), then go on to the next one.\r\n\r\nBut even more important than personal tasks you consider tackling is to think about what you can do for other people, within the constraints of social distancing or lockdown. If you can, contribute money to efforts to get more food, especially nutritious food that too often now goes to waste, to people who don’t have enough to eat, as well as to our essential workers.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://nyti.ms/31QYveW\"> Read More </a>'),
(NULL, 'Can sunlight treat Covid-19?', 'No. A new study found that it may potentially slow the spread of the disease, though not enough to wipe out the pathogen or keep the pandemic from resurging in the fall.\r\n\r\n“We found that ultraviolet light was most strongly associated with lower Covid-19 growth rates,” scientists wrote in a publication that has not yet been peer-reviewed. Projections of the overall effects, they continued, suggest that the disease “will decrease temporarily during summer, rebound by autumn, and peak next winter.” But they cautioned that uncertainty about the study’s projected outcomes “remains high.”'), 
(NULL, 'Will the warmer weather stop the spread?', 'Scientists are still looking into this. Some studies suggest that warmer places account for a smaller share of global cases and have had slower infection rates. But none of these findings have been peer-reviewed yet. And even if a certain temperature and humidity diminished the spread, that wouldn’t preclude the virus’ return when the weather cools again.'),
(NULL, 'Is there a natural cure for the coronavirus?', 'There is no proven cure for the coronavirus. But that has not stopped people (and some businesses) from claiming to have found one.\r\n\r\nDespite what you may have read online: Gargling with warm water will not keep you from getting the coronavirus. Neither will elderberry syrup or colloidal silver. Essential oils are not a good substitute for hand sanitizer.\r\n\r\nThe authorities are cracking down on those seeking to capitalize on peoples’ fears and anxieties right now. The F.D.A. sent warning letters to at least seven companies telling them to stop advertising fraudulent cures and treatments. The New York State attorney general ordered Alex Jones, the conservative radio host, to stop claiming that his diet supplements and toothpaste could be used to fight the coronavirus.'), 
(NULL, 'Is the virus on my clothes or in my hair?', 'Probably not. If you are practicing social distancing and making only occasional trips to the grocery store or pharmacy, experts agree that it’s not necessary to change clothes or take a shower when you return home. You should, however, always wash your hands.\r\n\r\nThe same advice goes for hair and facial hair: If you practice social distancing and wash your hands frequently, you probably don’t need to worry.'),
(NULL, 'Can I get the virus if I’m outside?', 'The risk of outdoor transmission is low, but it is possible. There is a growing consensus among experts that, if Americans are going to leave their homes, it’s safer to be outside than in the office or the mall. With fresh air and more space between people, the risk goes down.\r\n\r\nBut experts also expressed particular caution about outdoor dining, using locker rooms at pools and crowds in places like beaches. While going outside can help people cope with quarantine fatigue, there is a risk they will lower their guard or meet people who are not being safe.\r\n\r\nIdeally, you should socialize only with people who live in your home. If you decide to meet friends, you’re increasing your risk, but you can take precautions. It’s important to keep gatherings small. Don’t share food, utensils or beverages; keep your hands clean, and keep at least six feet from people.'), 
(NULL, 'Can I go to the park?', 'Yes! Getting exercise outside is a great alternative to going to the gym, where touching high-contact equipment can pose a risk (if your gym is even still open). Exercise boosts our immune systems, and even a single workout can improve our ability to fight off germs, according to the latest research. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea. Just be sure to wear a mask and maintain proper social distancing.')
(NULL, 'What if somebody in my family gets sick?', 'If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. in February. If there’s space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom to minimize contact with healthy family members. Any shared spaces should have good airflow, such as an open window or an air conditioner, and you shouldn’t allow any visitors except for those who need to be in the house. Your family member should wear a face mask when he or she is around others, and if he or she can’t because of difficulty breathing, you should wear a mask.\r\n\r\nMake sure not to share any dishes or other household items with your sick family member and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently.'), 
(NULL, 'Why do we need to stay six feet away? What’s magic about that number?', 'The coronavirus spreads primarily by droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. While a recent study suggested that gaseous clouds could travel up to 27 feet, six feet is the approximate range of larger droplets that are more likely to be infectious and is the distance recommended by the C.D.C.\r\n\r\nOur understanding about this strain of the coronavirus is constantly evolving, though. The World Health Organization advises at least 3 feet of distance.'),
 (NULL, 'What is convalescent plasma? What’s this about antibodies?', 'Convalescent plasma is the term used for the plasma — the liquid part of your blood composed mostly of water — of a person who has recovered from a disease.\r\n\r\nWhen your body is exposed to a foreign pathogen, your body’s response is to produce antibodies, “which are proteins that can bind to the virus and help to deactivate it, clear it from circulation and prevent it from invading the body’s cells,” according to Dr. Jeffrey Jhang, medical director of clinical laboratories and transfusion services for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York. Those antibodies are contained in plasma, and the hypothesis is that extracting the plasma of a recovered patient then transfusing it into a sick patient may help that person recover more quickly.\r\n\r\nBut we don’t yet know conclusively whether this will be an effective treatment for Covid-19, and it will be months before we do.\r\n<a href=\"https://nyti.ms/2VLHi34\"> Read More </a>'), 
 (NULL, 'Can you get the virus from eating food made by someone who was sick?', 'Probably not. For cooked food, heat likely inactivates the virus, though there hasn’t been a study looking at the specific temperatures and conditions.\r\n\r\nOf course there’s the concern that your delivery person who can\'t afford to stay home has just touched the containers, so you should always wash your hands before eating.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://nyti.ms/2ZBgcMZ\"> Read More </a>')
 (NULL, 'Are gloves a good way to protect myself?', 'Gloves become a second skin. They themselves could become contaminated (don’t touch your face!) and depending on how they’re made, they might have holes. While gloves may be helpful if someone in your household becomes sick, reducing the amount of times you have to wash your hands, the most effective intervention is just washing your hands.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://nyti.ms/2ZFqfAL\"> Read More </a>'),
 (NULL, 'I’ve recovered from Covid-19. How do I donate plasma?', 'To qualify, donors must pass normal blood-donation requirements and be symptom-free of Covid-19 for at least 14 days, and, in most cases, must have positive results from a test. (Other restrictions may apply, depending on the organization.)\r\n\r\nMany health care institutions nationwide are involved in plasma donations, including the Red Cross, so to find a location near you go to the website for the National Covid-19 Convalescent Plasma Project or visit the Red Cross’s website.')
